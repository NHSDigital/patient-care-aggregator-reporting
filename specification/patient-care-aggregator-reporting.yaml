    ## Overview
    Use this API to send events which happen within your service boundary to the Wayfinder Reporting Service.
    
    The Wayfinder Programme requires that key events that take place in all Wayfinder-integrated services be submitted to a central Wayfinder Reporting Service in order for the programme to produce Management Intelligence (MI) in a tool called Wayfinder Insights.

    Examples of events from Wayfinder-integrated systems are:

    | Service Boundary                                                                   | Example                                                                              |

    |[NHS App](https://www.nhs.uk/nhs-app/)                                              | A session has been started by a user logging into the NHS App                        |
    |[e-Referrals Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/e-referral-service)           | A referral has been viewed by a Wayfinder user in the e-Referrals Service            |
    |Patient Engagement Portals (PEPs)                                                   | A Wayfinder user has cancelled an appointment in a PEP's user interface.             |
    |[Patient Care Aggregator](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/patient-care-aggregator)  | A PEP has informed the Patient Care Aggregator that they have questionnaire data for a particular NHS Number|
    |Patient Engagement Portals (PEPs)                                                   | A PEP has sent an SMS message to a Wayfinder user                                    |
    |Patient Engagement Portals (PEPs)                                                   | A secondary care trust has informed a PEP that an appointment has been booked        |
    
    |                                                                                    |                                                                                      |
    |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

    Patient Engagement Portals (PEPs) are major contributors to the secondary care data used by Wayfinder. We sometimes call these secondary care providers, booking systems or patient portals.

    The set of events required from your service is defined in the "In Scope" section of each of the schemas detailed on this page.

    You may send multiple events in a single [request](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/6.1?topic=protocol-http-requests), or single events in multiple requests. This API is [idempotent](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Idempotent) so you may safely send the same event multiple times.
    
    If your service does not offer users the functionality to produce events that are defined by this specification as being within your service boundary, you do not have to send these events to the Wayfinder Reporting Service. For example, not all PEPs support the setting of patient preferences for communication and therefore cannot send these events.

    All events are related to an parent entity. For example, appointments have events indicating that an appointment has been viewed by the user. Questionnaires have events that indicate that a questionnaire has been completed by a user. You must send events for the creation or update of these parent entities if you send events related to those parent entities.

    ## Authorisation
    This API is [application-restricted with signed JWT authentication]([https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/application-restricted-restful-apis-signed-jwt-authentication)), meaning we authenticate and authorise the calling application but we do not authenticate or authorise the end user.

    In this pattern, you authenticate your application by sending a signed JSON Web Token (JWT) to our OAuth 2.0 authorisation server. You provide us with your public key and sign the JWT with your private key. In return, we give you an access token, which you then include with each API request.

    ## Who can use this API
    This API is for Wayfinder-internal use only.
    
    If you are interested in using this API in another context, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ## API status
    This API is [in production, beta but internal](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning the API is not currently available for integration by external third parties. If you want to use it, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support) and we'll look at making it available.
        
    If you would still like to be involved in our beta programme or use this API, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).

    ## Service level
    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational 24 x 7 x 365 but only supported during working hours.

    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels).
    
    ## Technology
    This API follows a centralised logging architectural pattern. It has been designed to minimise the need for your service to maintain state on events sent to the Wayfinder Reporting Service.
    
    We recommend triggering requests to the Wayfinder Reporting Service as they are written to your logs, but it is also possible to send batches of logged events if that approach makes more sense for your architecture. 
    
    You must adhere to the following requirements when sending events to the Wayfinder Reporting Service.

    | Requirement Reference | Requirement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | ----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | WF-NFR-MI-02          | You must implement a timeout of 20 seconds for requests to the Reporting Service, with a single retry for any such timeout.                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | WF-NFR-MI-03          | Requests to the Reporting Service must be sent at a maximum of 25 transactions per second. If this limit is breached, the Reporting Service will return a 429 (Too many requests) HTTP response.                                                                                                |
    | WF-NFR-MI-06          | You must meet the NHS Bronze availability requirement, i.e. a minimum of 98% of events generated within your service boundary must be sent to the Reporting Service.                                                                                                                            |                
    | WF-NFR-MI-04          | If you choose to send events to the Reporting Service in batches, the maximum delay between event generation and forwarding must be no more than twelve hours.                                                                                                                                  |
    | WF-NFR-MI-05          | If you choose to send events to the Reporting Service in batches, the maximum payload size is 2 megabytes.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | WF-NFR-MI-07          | You do not need to store any events sent to the Reporting Service if the service returns a 200 (OK) HTTP response. If the Reporting Service is unavailable, you must queue any failed requests to be sent once the service is available again.                                                  |
    | WF-NFR-MI-08          | If the Reporting Service is unavailable, you must queue any failed requests to be sent once the service is available again. See the Errors section below for more detail.                                                                                                                       |
    | WF-NFR-MI-11          | Full monitoring and alerting of requests sent to the Reporting Service must be in place, including logs of requests sent to the Reporting Service. The payload does not need to be logged (though must be queued in case of failure, as mentioned above). These logs must be stored for 90 days.|

    ### Sandbox testing
    This API does not have a sandbox environment, but you are may to send as many requests as you like to the Integration test environment while developing your API. If you would like us to add a sandbox environment, [contact us](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/help-and-support).
    
    ### Integration testing
    Our [integration test environment](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/testing#integration-testing):
    * is for formal integration testing, but may also be used for testing when developing your API
    * includes authorisation
    
    ## Onboarding
    You need to get your software approved by us before it can go live with this API. We call this onboarding. The onboarding process can sometimes be quite long, so it’s worth planning well ahead.
    
    This API is in production as a private beta. This means you will be directly contacted by the Wayfinder team if you are one of the private beta clients.

    ## Errors and actions we require you to take
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. The Reporting Service will return the following HTTP Status Codes.

    | Reporting Service Response  | Action required from your service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
